name: Bridgekeeper's Robes
description: This smelly, filthy garment must be made out of some special fabric in
  order to have withstood the foulness of the bridgekeeper's body. Oddly enough, it
  has plasma burns and scorch marks all over it, as if these weapons were used against
  it... to no effect. You have NO idea why it's purple.
