description: 'This squad-level support weapon has a bullpup design. The bullpup design
  makes it difficult to use while lying down. Because of this it was remanded to National
  Guard units. It, however, earned a reputation as a reliable weapon that packs a
  lot of punch for its size. Min ST: 6.'
