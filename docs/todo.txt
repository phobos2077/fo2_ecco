for *:


for "future":
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)
- rewrite Mr.Fixit to read config from INI file and texts from game/craft.msg
- sneak attack msg from combat.msg
- replace "handmade grenade" sprite
- add info about bonus move points to stat description
- replace some of the map changes with scripts where possible


IDEAS:
- one more "unarmed" weapon above Spiked Knuckles (knuckles with knife?)
- flashbang grenade (lose turn)
- molotov creates a circle of flame for 1-2 turns that damage when stepped on
- smoke grenade? (an immediate cloud of smoke in all directions that blocks LOS)
- add more drug types (Med-X?)
- add machete (above Combat Knife, non-thrown alternative to Axe)
- make robots drop "robot parts" and use them in crafting
- subsequent shots to the same target cost less AP (except bursts) - but can make guns even more powerful compared to melee/unarmed
- guaranteed damage bonus for head/eye shots? (will need to be countered by changing hit chance formula to require higher skill for 95%)
- barter: the more you sell to the same trader, the less is selling price
- trap system redesign:
   - More straightforward trap install (just drop & go)
   - Use traps skill for trap effectiveness instead of chance to install, which doesn't achieve anything
   - All traps should have minimum 1 tile radius
   - Add simple ready-to-go traps (maybe to vendors), without having to install explosive
