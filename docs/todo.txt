for 0.9.*:
- playtest


for "future":
- add early game Flamerthrower (Incinerator)
- Stimpak & Healing powder heal amt to depend upon First Aid skill
- Crafting: use items from party members inventory
- Crafting: read config from INI file and texts from game/craft.msg
- Crafting: add small XP rewards for crafting
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)
- sneak attack msg from combat.msg
- replace "handmade grenade" sprite
- replace Throwing Axe sprite
- add info about bonus move points to stat description


Considering:
- make stimpak irradiation optional using set_proto_data
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks?
- port auto-cursor from FO2Tweaks (with modifications)


IDEAS:
- Hunting Rifle -> Scoped for Slags rewards
- Marcus Scoped Rifle  to something better as reward
- remove early link to EPA (it has too OP enemies and loot)?
- Reduce ammo/drug loot in containers similar to critter loot and FNV Famine mod (less reduction for closed containers, etc.)
- one more "unarmed" weapon above Spiked Knuckles (knuckles with knife?)
- flashbang grenade (lose turn)
- molotov creates a circle of flame for 1-2 turns that damage when stepped on
- smoke grenade? (an immediate cloud of smoke in all directions that blocks LOS)
- add more drug types (Med-X?)
- add machete (above Combat Knife, non-thrown alternative to Axe)
- make robots drop "robot parts" and use them in crafting
- subsequent shots to the same target cost less AP (except bursts) - but can make guns even more powerful compared to melee/unarmed
- guaranteed damage bonus for head/eye shots? (will need to be countered by changing hit chance formula to require higher skill for 95%)
- barter: the more you sell to the same trader, the less is selling price
- some new trap-related perk (arm traps in combat?)
- add simple ready-to-go traps (maybe to vendors), without having to install explosive
