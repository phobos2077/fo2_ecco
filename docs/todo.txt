for 0.9:
- decide on script and INI naming
- compare text changes to 0.8 and update RU texts
- review and update full readme
- update RU readme


for "future":
- attempt to make melee useful for mid game (stun, knoknout effects, penetrate for knives, etc.)
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)
- rewrite Mr.Fixit to read config from INI file and texts from game/craft.msg
- sneak attack msg from combat.msg
- replace "handmade grenade" sprite




IDEAS:
- melee buff similar to throwing: increase max damage based on skill, use attack mode as "caliber", e.g. "thrust" attacks should incur DR Adjust while Swing have higher DMG
- add more drug types (Med-X?)
- add machete (above Combat Knife, non-thrown alternative to Axe)
- make robots drop "robot parts" and use them in crafting
- subsequent shots to the same target cost less AP (except bursts)
- add penetrate to bladed weapons and knockback to blunt
- guaranteed damage bonus for head/eye shots? (will need to be countered by changing hit chance formula to require higher skill for 95%)
- barter: the more you sell to the same trader, the less is selling price
- trap system redesign:
   - More straightforward trap install (just drop & go)
   - Use traps skill for trap effectiveness instead of chance to install, which doesn't achieve anything
   - All traps should have minimum 1 tile radius
   - Add simple ready-to-go traps (maybe to vendors), without having to install explosive
