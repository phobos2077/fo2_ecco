for 1.0.0:
- finish Big Guns run
- add warning message if wrong sfall version is used (save version to ini, if it changed and still wrong, show message again)

for 0.9.7:
- playtest


for "future":
- custom craft schematic art
- cavern encounters need rebalance!!
- take a look at 4/5 AP cost for pistols
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)


Considering:
- installer switch to disable barter formula
- random encounter: more interesting enemy formations?
- add Cattle Prod to Modoc, VC, Gecko, Broken Hills (check balance)
- add crafting components like rocks and junk to human enemy bodies on death with small probability
- Hunting Rifle -> Scoped for Slags rewards
- Marcus Scoped Rifle  to something better as reward
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks?
- port auto-cursor from FO2Tweaks (with modifications)


IDEAS:
- more powerful crafted grenade (3 home-made grenades bundled together?)
- NEW PERK: +1 to carry over AP
- NEW PERK: subsequent shots to the same target cost less AP (except bursts)
- map loot reduction based on removal statistics, with no random rolls?
- don't allow to craft "factory-level" items like Metal armor, but allow upgrades to Mk2
- crafting some advanced leather armor
- crafting robes?
- crafting more advanced items require Workbench (scenery object) in close proximity (check FRM from FOnline)
- add another Sword-like weapon to take advantage of new Wakizashi animation in RPU (Make-shift sword? Between Wakizashi and Combat Knife, but heavy)
- remove early link to EPA (it has too OP enemies and loot)? - on the other hand, the area has lots of difficult random encounters!
- one more "unarmed" weapon above Spiked Knuckles (knuckles with knife?)
- flashbang grenade (lose turn)
- molotov creates a circle of flame for 1-2 turns that damage when stepped on
- smoke grenade? (an immediate cloud of smoke in all directions that blocks LOS)
- add more drug types (Med-X?)
- add machete (above Combat Knife, non-thrown alternative to Axe)
- add "metal sheets" crafting item and distribute along with "Junk"
- make robots drop "robot parts" and use them in crafting
- some new trap-related perk (arm traps in combat?)
- add simple ready-to-go traps (maybe to vendors), without having to install explosive
