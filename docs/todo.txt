for 0.9:
- attempt to change DR/DT reduction in damage mod
- ELSE - tweak armor DT values (esp. for BOSS)
- add 7.62 AP ammo & rebalance 7.62 weapons
- consider replacing 12ga Buckshot (new) with more interesting variant
- review perk/skill reqs for early craft (too high from feedback)
- remove 9mm SMG and second 9mm ammo type from stores and worldmap
- review weapon distribution in stores


for "future":
- rewrite weapons mod to be configurable from ini
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)
