for 0.9.6:
- playtest


for "future":
- take a look at 4/5 AP cost for pistols
- add warning message if wrong sfall version is used (save version to ini, if it changed and still wrong, show message again)
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)


Considering:
- take another look at incenirator balance
- Demolition Expert to reduce AP to arm traps
- Reduce ammo/drug loot in containers similar to critter loot and FNV Famine mod (less reduction for closed containers, etc.)
- add Cattle Prod to Modoc, VC, Gecko, Broken Hills (check balance)
- add crafting components like rocks and junk to human enemy bodies on death with small probability
- Hunting Rifle -> Scoped for Slags rewards
- Marcus Scoped Rifle  to something better as reward
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks?
- port auto-cursor from FO2Tweaks (with modifications)


IDEAS:
- deflation: increase value of money buy reducing buying and selling price bias by the same % (will make monetary rewards more meaningful)
- don't allow to craft "factory-level" items like Metal armor, but allow upgrades to Mk2
- crafting some advanced leather armor
- crafting robes?
- crafting more advanced items require Workbench (scenery object) in close proximity (check FRM from FOnline)
- add another Sword-like weapon to take advantage of new Wakizashi animation in RPU (Make-shift sword? Between Wakizashi and Combat Knife, but heavy)
- remove early link to EPA (it has too OP enemies and loot)? - on the other hand, the area has lots of difficult random encounters!
- one more "unarmed" weapon above Spiked Knuckles (knuckles with knife?)
- flashbang grenade (lose turn)
- molotov creates a circle of flame for 1-2 turns that damage when stepped on
- smoke grenade? (an immediate cloud of smoke in all directions that blocks LOS)
- add more drug types (Med-X?)
- add machete (above Combat Knife, non-thrown alternative to Axe)
- add late-game super spear, above Piston Spear (Plasma?)
- add "metal sheets" crafting item and distribute along with "Junk"
- make robots drop "robot parts" and use them in crafting
- subsequent shots to the same target cost less AP (except bursts) - but can make guns even more powerful compared to melee/unarmed
- guaranteed damage bonus for head/eye shots? (will need to be countered by changing hit chance formula to require higher skill for 95%)
- barter: the more you sell to the same trader, the less is selling price
- some new trap-related perk (arm traps in combat?)
- add simple ready-to-go traps (maybe to vendors), without having to install explosive
