for 0.9:
- tweak damage formula
- attempt to change bullet distribution in bursts (ComputeSpray + burst size reduction?)
- add 7.62 AP ammo & rebalance 7.62 weapons
- review perk/skill reqs for early craft (too high from feedback)


for "future":
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)
