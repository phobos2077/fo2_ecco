for 0.9:
- integrate 7.62 AP ammo & rebalance 7.62 weapons
- integrate new guns
- review perk/skill reqs for early craft (too high from feedback)
- remove 9mm SMG and second 9mm ammo type from stores and worldmap
- convert Mauser to 10mm to complement P90c as mid-game 10mm
- add grenade launcher to more enemies
- fix crafting button visual (change iface panel)
- review armor class for armors
- review weapon distribution in stores
- review and update full readme
- compare text changes to 0.8 and update RU texts
- update RU readme


for "future":
- attempt to make melee useful for mid game (stun, knoknout effects, penetrate for knives, etc.)
- rewrite weapons mod to be configurable from ini
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)
- rewrite Mr.Fixit to read from INI file





IDEAS:
- subsequent shots to the same target cost less AP (except bursts)
- add penetrate to bladed weapons and knockback to blunt
- guaranteed damage bonus for head/eye shots? ()
