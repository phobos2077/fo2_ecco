for 0.9:
- review armor class for armors
- review and update full readme
- ensure fire death anims for Dragon Breath
- investigate critter_dmg fix in deathanim2
- decide on script and INI naming
- kill experience reduction option (flat multiplier or falloff based on kill type?)
- compare text changes to 0.8 and update RU texts
- update RU readme


for "future":
- attempt to make melee useful for mid game (stun, knoknout effects, penetrate for knives, etc.)
- fix art position for some items (read size from FRM?)
- rewrite weapons mod to be configurable from ini
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)
- rewrite Mr.Fixit to read config from INI file and texts from game/craft.msg
- sneak attack msg from combat.msg
- replace "handmade grenade" sprite




IDEAS:
- add more drug types (Med-X?)
- add machete (above Combat Knife, non-thrown alternative to Axe)
- make robots drop "robot parts" and use them in crafting
- subsequent shots to the same target cost less AP (except bursts)
- add penetrate to bladed weapons and knockback to blunt
- guaranteed damage bonus for head/eye shots? (will need to be countered by changing hit chance formula to require higher skill for 95%)
- barter: the more you sell to the same trader, the less is selling price
