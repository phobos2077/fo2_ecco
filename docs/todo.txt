for 0.9:
- integrate 7.62 AP ammo & rebalance 7.62 weapons
- integrate 14mm SMG
- review perk/skill reqs for early craft (too high from feedback)
- add grenade launcher to more enemies
- crafting: fix iface panel art for button, fix art position for some items (read size from FRM?)
- decide on script and INI naming 
- review armor class for armors
- review weapon distribution in stores
- review and update full readme
- compare text changes to 0.8 and update RU texts
- update RU readme


for "future":
- attempt to make melee useful for mid game (stun, knoknout effects, penetrate for knives, etc.)
- rewrite weapons mod to be configurable from ini
- port "grenades anywhere" script from FO2Tweaks
- add tie-ins to barter "demand" feature, have some trader explain it in dialog (and maybe also boost your barter skill)
- rewrite Mr.Fixit to read from INI file
- replace "handmade grenade" sprite




IDEAS:
- subsequent shots to the same target cost less AP (except bursts)
- add penetrate to bladed weapons and knockback to blunt
- guaranteed damage bonus for head/eye shots? (will need to be countered by changing hit chance formula to require higher skill for 95%)
- barter: the more you sell to the same trader, the less is selling price
