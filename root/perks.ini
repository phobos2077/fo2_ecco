;This file handles modifications to perks and traits
;When adding extra perks to a mod, it's advisable to use
; the fake perk scripting functions rather than make modifications
; in this file, as some perks have hardcoded effects which may
; catch you out
;Since traits need to be picked before any scripts run, they
; have an additional NoHardcode option in this file which can
; be used to remove their hardcoded effects, and add new stat/skill effects

;This is a modification to perk Bonus Rate of Fire
