; where "base" is base item price (set in prototypes),
;    "price" is price you will see in game,
;    "party_barter" is player's barter skill in %s (0..300) + possible bonus from a party member (see PartyBonusMult),
;    "merchant_barter" is the barter skill of merchant,
;    "dude_charisma" is player charisma (1..10),
;    "master_trader" is Master Trader perk (0..1)
;    "barter_mod" is set in scripts on specific events (like getting a discount for a quest) (-40..no upper limit)
;
; NOTE: with this formula, all variables (skills, reputation, etc.) affect final price independently. 
; It means that, if all other variables are constant, given variable will always affect final price in the same way 
; (eg. one charisma point will always add 10% or Master Trader perk will always add 25%)
;
; NOTE: What if you want (for example) charisma multiplier to change from 0.6 to 1.5 (Coef = 0.1, Bias = 0.2):
; - 0.5 is your lowered bias for charisma multiplier (because minimum charisma is 1)
; - multiply Bias with this lowered bias (Bias = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1)
; - divide DudeCharismaCoef by this lowered bias (DudeCharismaCoef = 0.1 / 0.5 = 0.2)
; apply above steps for each multiplier
;
; NOTE: If you want to make selling prices constant like in vanilla game, set all Coefs to 0 and Bias to 1

; where "party_skill" is the highest Barter Skill amongst party member, NOT including player.

; NOTE: VANILLA formula for comparison:
; price = base * 2
;              * (160.0 + merchant_barter)
;              / (160.0 + party_barter)
;              * (barter_mod + 100.0 - master_trader_mod) * 0.01
;
; where "master_trader_mod" is 25 or 0 and "party_barter" is highest barter in party, including player.

; The following are balanced settings 
; - about 15% higher prices at very low barter relative to vanilla game, 
; - equal to vanilla at around 60-80 barter, 
; - slightly lower than vanilla at high barter
