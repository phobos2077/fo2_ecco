[SELL]
; selling price formula:
; price = base * Bias
;           * (1 + DudeSkillCoef*dude_barter)  // dude skill multiplier
;           * (1 + MerchantSkillCoef*merchant_barter)  // merchant skill multiplier
;           * (1 + DudeCharismaCoef*dude_charisma)  // dude charisma multiplier
;           * (1 + TownRepCoef*town_rep)  // town rep multiplier
;           * (1 + BarterModCoef*barter_mod)  // barter mod multiplier
;           * (1 + PerkCoef*master_trader);  // perk multiplier
;
; where "base" is base item price (set in prototypes),
;    "price" is price you will see in game,
;    "dude_barter" and "merchant_barter" are the barter skill levels in %s (0..300),
;    "dude_charisma" is player charisma (1..10),
;    "town_rep" is reputation in current town (-30..+30; 30 is "vilified" and 30 is "idolized"),
;    "master_trader" is Master Trader perk (0..1)
;    "barter_mod" is set in scripts on specific events (like getting a discount for a quest) (-40..no upper limit)
;
; NOTE: with this formula, all variables (skills, reputation, etc.) affect final price independently. 
; It means that, if all other variables are constant, given variable will always affect final price in the same way 
; (eg. one charisma point will always add 10% or Master Trader perk will always add 25%)
;
; NOTE: as in vanilla, party NPC with highest skill is taken for "dude_barter"
;
; NOTE: What if you want (for example) charisma multiplier to change from 0.6 to 1.5 (Coef = 0.1, Bias = 0.2):
; - 0.5 is your lowered bias for charisma multiplier (because minimum charisma is 1)
; - multiply Bias with this lowered bias (Bias = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1)
; - divide DudeCharismaCoef by this lowered bias (DudeCharismaCoef = 0.1 / 0.5 = 0.2)
; apply above steps for each multiplier
;
; NOTE: If you want to make selling prices constant like in vanilla game, set all Coefs to 0 and Bias to 1 or whatever you want

[BUY]
; select desired formula for buying price calculation (number)
; 0:
; price = vanilla_price * Bias;
;     where "vanilla_price" is item buy price as in vanilla game;
;
; 1: ABSOLETE
;
; 2: (vanilla price with skill-based arctangent multiplier)
; price = vanilla_price * Bias * (1 + arctan(ArctanCoef*dude_barter)*DudeSkillCoef))
;
; 3: (same formula as selling price, see above and use appropriate signs for coefficients)
;
; 4: (like 3 but uses arctangent function)
; price = base * Bias
;           * (1 + arctan(ArctanCoef*dude_barter)*DudeSkillCoef)  // dude skill multiplier (arctangent)
;           * (1 + MerchantSkillCoef*merchant_barter)  // merchant skill multiplier (linear)
;           * (1 + DudeCharismaCoef*dude_charisma)  // dude charisma multiplier
;           * (1 + TownRepCoef*town_rep)  // town rep multiplier (linear)
;           * (1 + BarterModCoef*barter_mod)  // barter mod multiplier (linear)
;           * (1 + PerkCoef*master_trader);  // perk multiplier (on or off)
;
; NOTE: vanilla prices are affected by following variables (exact formula is unknown):
; - dude barter skill (affected by charisma)
; - merchant barter skill (affected by charisma)
; - dude "Master Trader" perk (25% discount)
; - barter mod set in scripts (observed vanilla coefficient: 0.008 or barter_mod/125)
;

; The following are balanced settings 
; - about 25% higher prices at low barter relative to vanilla game, 
; - equal to vanilla at around 90 barter, 
; - slightly lower than vanilla at high barter 
; (this was tested with no discounts, master trader perk against "bad merchant" NPC class)
