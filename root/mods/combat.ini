[DAMAGE]
; A fraction [0..1] of shots in a critical burst attack that will keep armor bypass and critical damage multiplier.
; For example, if set to 0.5, 10 bullets hit target and attack was a critical, first 5 bullets will retain the full damage and bypass (if any) of the attack. 5 remaining bullets will deal normal damage as if there was no critical.
; NOTE: first bullet always retains bypass and multiplier.
; To disable, set to 1.

; DT affected by ammo DR Adjust value. Set separate modes for positive (JHP) and negative (AP) values. Available modes:
; 0 - no effect (vanilla)
; 1 - addition (DT = armor_dt + dr_adjust / 10 * dt_mult)
; 2 - multiplication (DT = armor_dt * (1 + dr_adjust * dt_mult / 100))
